# Feed the Needy 🌍🍲

**A platform to connect donors and receivers to reduce food wastage.**

## 📌 About the Project
Feed the Needy is a web-based application that helps bridge the gap between food donors and people in need. Donors can list surplus food, and receivers can claim it on a first-come, first-served basis. This initiative aims to reduce food waste and provide meals to those in need.

## 🚀 Features

- **User Authentication** – Secure login and registration for donors and receivers.
- **Food Donation System** – Donors can post food details (quantity, location, and contact info).
- **Claim & Track Donations** – Receivers can browse available donations and claim them.
- **Google Maps Integration** – Users can navigate to pickup locations.
- **Real-Time Notifications** – Alerts for new food donations.
- **Database Management** – Uses MySQL for authentication and MongoDB for tracking donations.
